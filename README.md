# Snake Game in C++

This repository contains a simple Snake Game implementation in C++. The game is played on the console and uses basic console input/output functions for interaction.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
4. Use the following controls to play:
   - `W` or `↑`: Move the snake up
   - `S` or `↓`: Move the snake down
   - `A` or `←`: Move the snake left
   - `D` or `→`: Move the snake right
   - `X`: Stop the game (optional)
5. Eat the fruits (*) to increase your score and avoid colliding with the snake's own tail or the walls.

## Features

- Simple and straightforward gameplay.
- Console-based user interface.
- Score tracking and game-over detection.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
- Windows operating system for using `windows.h` and `conio.h` libraries.
